Aadhaar Data Analysis – UIDAI Data Hackathon
📌 Overview

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of Aadhaar enrolment, biometric, and demographic datasets to uncover societal trends, operational gaps, and data quality issues.
The solution focuses on data cleaning, anomaly detection, trend analysis, and actionable insights to support data-driven governance and administrative planning.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze large-scale Aadhaar datasets

Identify data errors and inconsistencies

Detect anomalies and regional patterns

Support decision-making with clear insights and forecasts

📂 Datasets Used

Aadhaar Enrolment Data – age-wise enrolment trends

Biometric Update Data – biometric coverage and update cycles

Demographic Update Data – population mobility and corrections

Each dataset includes state, district, date, age groups, and geospatial attributes.

⚠️ Data Issues Identified

Duplicate records

Inconsistent state and district names

Invalid or mismatched pincodes

Uneven data distribution across regions

These issues reflect real-world government data challenges.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Processing

Removed duplicate records

Standardized state and district names

Fixed naming issues using reference mappings

Added latitude & longitude using pincode mapping

Validated data after each transformation

📊 Analysis Highlights

Zone-wise and state-wise enrolment patterns

Biometric update trends and low-activity regions

Demographic update behaviour in migration-heavy districts

Anomaly detection in border and tribal regions

Seasonal trends and workload forecasting

🔍 Key Insights

Enrolment saturation in several southern and western states

Migration-heavy districts show high demographic update activity

Infrastructure gaps in low biometric-update regions

Strong seasonal patterns in enrolment and updates

💡 Recommendations

Early-warning system for abnormal drops or spikes

Targeted outreach for child biometric updates

Predictive capacity planning for enrolment centres

Stronger data validation at source
